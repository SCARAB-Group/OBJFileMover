# OBJFileMover
Makes syncronization of OBJ-files easy as 3.1415

## Usage:
Configure source and target paths in config.json. Source path is the LIMS production directory and the target paths are the background server directories. Then just run the script and watch the magic happen!

Note: the script will rename any existing file by adding a suffix with today's date, e.g. LIMSBBPROD_160102.OBJ
